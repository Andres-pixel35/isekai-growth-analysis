# What's an isekai? 
## For the scope of this analysis

*Isekai* is a **sub-genre** of fiction that revolve around a person o people who are **transported** to and have to survive in another world, such as a *fantasy world*, *game world* or a *parallel universe*, with or without the possibility of returning to their original work. 

An anime will be considered an isekai as long as it meets the following requirements:
1.  The main character has to be among the people transported to the another world. Should the main character be the one transporting the people or be a native of such world, then it would not be considered an isekai.

2.  The world cannot be reachable through any technological mean, therefore it has to be a world in a completely different universe from the one the main character comes from.. with some nuances:
    1. In case of a *game world* the main character must be trapped there, meaning he cannot leave at will.
    2. In a *parallel universe*, this new universe must be quite different from the original. Additionally, plots where characters are trapped in loops or time travel within their original world should not be considered isekais, since they are not in another world. In time loops, the branch where the main character stands is usually changed, meaning that events and other things change as well. This may lead to the incorrect conclusion that this branching is a parallel universe and thus an isekai. For this analysis, time loops must occur once the character is in another world. 
    3. It does not have to be only one world, as long as it meets the previous requirements it does not matter if the main character changes the world constantly through the anime.

3.  The main character has to be in the another wold most part of the time, should they only be in the other world half of the time, then it would no longer qualify as an isekai.

4. Realms are not other worlds. Since the realms coexist and interfere with each other from time to time, it cannot be considered an isekai.

## Examples
I think this will be even more clear with some examples, so let's do that.

**Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road** summons people from Japan, drives them mad, and turns their pure concepts into magic that can be learned and cast. If the main character were the one being summoned and forced to face this world, it would obviously be an isekai. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
Menou is a native of that world and is one of those tasked with killing the summoned people. Can we really call that an isekai? I don't think so.

**Infinite Dendrogram** is an anime where all the time there are inside the game world, but they are not actually attraped there, they can leave at will and they do so.
**Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear** instead has their main character trapped in the game world. Altough both of them looks like the same, there is a nuance that make one of them an isekai and the other not.

**Yu Yu Hakusho** has three different realms: the Human Realm, the Demon Realm, and the Spirit Realm. All of them coexist, and demons depend on human flesh to survive, so they are closely connected. The main character travels between them throughout the anime. Does that mean he is going to other worlds? No. Those realms are part of the same world; therefore, it is not an isekai.
