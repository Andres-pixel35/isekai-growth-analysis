# Limitations

This document outlines the key limitations of the dataset and analysis that may affect the interpretation of results. These factors should be considered when drawing conclusions from the findings.

## Data Quality Issues

To assess the reliability of the dataset, I manually verified a sample of **55 anime titles**, examining each one individually against their tags. Of these, **4 were found to be incorrectly tagged** (approximately 7.3%). While this sampling approach has limitations—notably the small sample size and potential selection bias—it provides an initial indication of data quality concerns.

The identified tagging issues include:

- **Incorrect genre classifications**: Some anime are tagged with genres that don't accurately reflect their content, such as slice-of-life series being categorized as isekai when it does not have nothing to do with one. 
- **Incomplete metadata**: Critical tags and categorizations are absent, limiting the ability to properly classify and group related titles.

These inconsistencies likely arise from both manual tagging errors and limitations in the automated systems used to compile the dataset. Even with a relatively low error rate in the sample, incorrect tags can distort **genre distribution metrics** and compromise the accuracy of **trend analysis**. Patterns observed in the data may not fully reflect the true characteristics of the anime landscape, particularly for less common genres where a few misclassifications can have a disproportionate impact.

## Temporal Limitations

The dataset contains anime titles released only through **2024**, despite this analysis being conducted in **2026**. This two-year gap creates a notable constraint on the findings:

Any conclusions regarding current trends are limited to the state of the industry as of 2024. Recent developments in genres, emerging styles, or shifts in viewership patterns from 2025-2026 are not captured in this analysis. Results should be interpreted as historical rather than contemporary.

## Methodological Limitations

This represents my first statistical analysis project, conducted primarily as a learning exercise. As such, there are some methodological limitations to be aware of:

- Some statistical methods may not be optimal for the data being analyzed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps could be refined further
- Certain interpretations may lack the depth that comes with more experience

I've made efforts to minimize errors, but there may be oversights that affect the accuracy of the results. I recommend viewing the conclusions as exploratory rather than definitive.
