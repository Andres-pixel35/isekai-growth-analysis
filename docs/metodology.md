# Questions and Metodology

## Has the Isekai genre had a considerable growth in this millennium?
### Methodology for Considerable Growth
- The Annual Isekai Releases and the Total Annual Anime Industry Releases will be tracked and plotted for the period spanning 2000 to 2024.

- The Isekai genre's growth will be considered considerable if it meets two criteria:
  1. The total number of Isekai releases in 2020 to 2024 must show an increase of greater than 100% compared to the number of releases in 2000 to 2024.
  2. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the Isekai sub-genre over the 2000-2025 period must significantly exceed the CAGR calculated for the total annual output of the entire anime industry for the same period.

## Does the Isekai genre represent an abnormal amount of animes?
### Methodology for Abnormality Assessment

- **Distribution Plotting**: The annual count of anime releases for every sub-genre tag will be plotted across two distinct periods: (2000–2024) for historical context, and the last 10 years (2015–2024) to focus on the modern, streaming-dominated era. This establishes the two relevant baseline genre distributions.

- **Statistical Outlier Test**: For each period, the median and dispersion of the annual sub-genre counts will be calculated using robust statistics (such as the interquartile range or median absolute deviation). If the Isekai sub-genre’s annual count lies far beyond the typical range of variation—for example, outside the upper whisker defined by 1.5×IQR or an equivalent robust threshold—it will be classified as a statistically significant outlier. Such results will be considered strong evidence that Isekai released a disproportionately high and statistically abnormal number of anime during that timeframe.

- **Contextual Comparison**: Any result obtained here will be compared with one or two of the most popular sub-genres to determine whether isekai forms part of a group of popular sub-genres or whether it is the dominant sub-genre.
